Decarbonization strategies have emerged as an innovative approach to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and achieve net zero goals. These strategies include carbon capture and storage (CCS), industrial electrification, facility decommissioning, and fuel-switching to options such as clean hydrogen. Along with CO2 emissions, decarbonization also affects the emissions of conventional air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur oxides (SOx). With the growing interest in advancing environmental justice through climate policy, it is crucial to understand the socioeconomic impacts of decarbonization and the social costs associated with each decarbonization technology.

In this study, we estimate changes in air pollutant emissions resulting from amine-based CCS applied to industrial point-source facilities across the U.S., using the CO2 National Capture Opportunities and Readiness Database (CO2NCORD). This CO2NCORD tool estimates capturable CO2 emissions and the cost-per-tonne for industrial point sources. We use the INMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution) model to compute the annual PM2.5 concentration with the modified emissions by amine-based CCS and the BenMAP-CE (Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program - Community Edition) model to estimate the health impacts of amine-based CCS in the U.S., as well as the monetized values of those health impacts. We estimate the overall cost of amine-based CCS by incorporating the valuation results from BenMAP-CE into the cost-per-tonne from CO2NCORD.

The overall goals of our study are to assess the socioeconomic impacts of decarbonization strategies, focused on air quality, public health, and equity, and to identify effective decarbonization technologies for specific regions.

1. Faciltiy emissions analysis 
    - why some facilities have higher NH3 emissions than others?
    - Identify county with high NH3 facilities
    - What is the main factor to increase NH3? 
2. INMAP PM2.5 analysis
    - Changes of PM2.5 by LA CCS using INMAP
    - Changes of PM2.5 from the facilities distance? 
3. BenMAP health impact analysis
    - Changes in mortality and morbidity by LA CCS (with and without NH3 emissions)
    - Impact on which race and which vulnerable commuties
    - Compare Valuataion cost (social cost and CCS operational cost)
