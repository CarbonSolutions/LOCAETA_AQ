# Local Climate and Air Emissions Tracking Atlas (LOCAETA)

LOCAETA is an interactive, user-friendly data platform that utilizes a suite of cutting-edge atmospheric datasets (ground-based and remote sensing) and models to demonstrate the impact of decarbonization technologies on local air quality and public health.

## LOCAETA Data Explorer

The [LOCAETA Data Explorer](https://apps.carbonsolutionsllc.com/locaeta/) will be made available to the public online. This platform provides:

- Screening-level modeling across the US
- Satellite and in situ sensor data integration
- Identification of industrial facilities impacting community airsheds

### Decarbonization Options to Explore

- Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
- Industrial Electrification
- Fuel-switching to hydrogen or other clean fuels

Each option includes corresponding air quality co-benefits calculated at the facility level and public health benefits estimated for communities across a wide geographic area.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the code used for LOCAETA's air quality modeling and impact analysis. Currently, it uses the INMAP air quality model and performs a detailed public health assessment with well-established methods such as BenMAP.

- **INMAP Air Quality Model**: See the details of INMAP [here](https://inmap.run/)
- **Public Health Assessment**: Utilizes methods like BenMAP for comprehensive analysis.
